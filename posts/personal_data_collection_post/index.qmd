In this project I explored how my productivity levels changed based on the music genre I listened to. I wanted to explore this topic because listening to music is a big part of my life and I was curious to dive into the effect that the music genres had on me. To collect my data, after a study session I would gather the following data: Study Period (min), Tasks Completed, Music Genre, Work Environment, Number of Distractions, Time of Day, Amount of Sleep, and Productivity. The productivity variable was a calculated variable. To calculate it I made sure to distinguish the levels of tasks, level 1 to level 5, by the time it should take for a task. These are my judgement before completing the task on how long the task itself should take normally. For example, I level 1 task should take around up to 30 minutes, a level 2 task should take 30 minutes to an hour, a level 3 should take 1-2 hours, and level 4 task should take 2-4 hours, and a level 5 task should take more than 4 hours.

## Making Visualization of Personal Data

# Setup

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(flextable)
library(readxl)
library(janitor)

# read in personal data
personal <- read_csv(
  # file path
  here("posts", "personal_data_collection_post", "personal_data_v2.csv"))
```

# Cleaning Data

```{r, data-cleaning}
# creatig clean data frame
personal_cleaned <- personal |> # choosing personal data frame
  # cleaning column names
  clean_names() |> # cleaning names
  select(date, study_period, music_genre, work_environment, time_of_day, sleep, productivity) # selecting columns for cleaned data frame
```

# Visualization

```{r, making-plot}
ggplot(data = personal_cleaned, # choose data frame
       aes(x = music_genre, # assign x-axis
           y = productivity, # assign y-axis
           fill = music_genre)) + # assign boxes by music_genre
  geom_boxplot(color = "black") + # make box plot
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(    # assign custom colors to each genre
    "Classical" = "#66c2a5",
    "No Music" = "#ffd92f",
    "Lofi" = "purple",
    "Indie Rock" = "darkgrey"
  )) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, # making points jitter horizontally
              alpha = 0.5, # making points slightly transparent
              color = "black") + # making points black
  stat_summary(fun = mean, # calculate the mean of productivity for each music genre
             geom = "point", # add a point at the mean value
             color = "firebrick", # set the point color to a muted red for emphasis
             size = 5) + # increase point size for visibility
  labs(x = "Music Genre", # changing label for x-axis
       y = "Productivity (Tasks completed per hour)", # changing label for y-axis
       title = "Average Task Completion Rate Based on Music Genre") + # adding title name
  theme_minimal() + # adding minimal theme
  theme(legend.position = "none") # getting rid of legend
```

# Figure Caption

**Figure 1. Productivity Rate is highest when listening to Classical music** 
Data from 'personal_data_v2.csv' (Lescano, L. 2025). Points represent individual study period productivity rate (total n = 16), jittered horizontally to reduce overlap. Bold horizontal line represents the mean productivity rate for the group.

# Summarizing Data and Make Table

```{r, summarizing-data}
# Step 1: Summarise the data by music genre

summary_table <- personal_cleaned |> # creating summarized data object
  group_by(music_genre) |> # group rows by music genre
  summarise(mean_productivity = round(mean(productivity, # calculates mean within each group
                                           na.rm = TRUE), 1))
# Step 2: Create and format flextable

flextable(summary_table) |> # create a table from the summary data
  set_header_labels( # rename column headers for clarity
    music_genre = "Music Genre",
    mean_productivity = "Mean Productivity (Tasks Completed per Hour)"
  ) |> 
    align(j = "mean_productivity", align = "center", part = "all") |> #center values in productivity column
  color(color = "white", part = "all") |>  # make the color white
  autofit() |> # auto-adjust column widths to fit content
  add_header_lines("Average Productivity Rate by Music Genre") # add a custom title above the table
```

For this project, I also created an affective visualization from the results I found from my visualization above.

## Creating an Affective Visualization

# Description

An affective visualization of my personal data could take the form of a stylized soundwave, where each genre is represented by a different color and the line thickness represents my productivity level. If one music genre has a higher productivity rate, then the peaks will be greater and it will appear more like a crescendo. This would visually and emotionally connect the act of studying with the type of music I was listening to, blending form with feeling. The visualization would not only communicate data, but how it felt to study with each kind of music, ultimately by the difference in productivity rates visually represented.

# Artistic Statement

This piece visualizes how different music genres impacted my productivity during study sessions. Each wave represents a genre, with the height and flow of the line representing the average rate at which I completed tasks, translating data into emotional rhythm.
I was inspired by the affective visual strategies of Jill Pelto, who integrates data into landscape art, and the Dear Data project by Posavec and Lupi, which emphasized personal, emotional storytelling through visual abstraction. I aimed to combine sound wave aesthetics with gentle color gradients to create a sense of movement and tone.
The form is a hand-drawn illustration, using colored pencil and ink to create layered waveforms that reflect the amplitude of productivity across music genres. The organic lines and textures evoke a more personal, emotional connection to the data.
