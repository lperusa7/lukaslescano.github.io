### Project Overview

As transportation electrifies, heavy-duty and agricultural equipment remain largely dependent on diesel. This project explores whether Rivian, an EV manufacturer known for sustainable innovation, could accelerate decarbonization in the farming industry through horizontal integration into electric tractors.

The objective was to evaluate whether Rivian’s capabilities in battery systems, vertically integrated software, and sustainability branding could translate into a competitive advantage in agricultural machinery.


### Why Agriculture Matters in the Energy Transition

Agriculture remains one of the most diesel-dependent industries globally. Electrifying tractors presents:

- Emissions reductions
- Lower long-term operating costs
- Integration with renewable charging infrastructure
- Alignment with ESG and sustainable supply chain goals

This represents an overlooked frontier in clean energy deployment.


### Reframing the Tractor

Rather than treating the tractor as a mechanical machine, we framed it as:

- A mobile energy storage asset
- A connected data platform
- A precision agriculture tool
- A software-defined machine

This shift from hardware to integrated energy system reflects the broader electrification movement across sectors.


### Strategic Analysis

We applied:

- Porter’s Five Forces
- Resource-Based View
- Value Chain analysis

to assess industry attractiveness and Rivian’s ability to execute.

The analysis revealed:

- Low current rivalry in EV tractors
- High barriers to entry
- A strong opportunity for first-mover advantage
- Rivian’s vertically integrated software stack as a key differentiator


### Strategic Recommendation

We recommended a differentiation strategy centered on:

- High-performance electric tractors
- Precision agriculture software
- Long-term farm partnerships
- Leveraging government electrification incentives
- Establishing early market control

The goal: position Rivian not just as a tractor manufacturer, but as a catalyst for sustainable agriculture.


### Personal Reflection

This project reflects my interest in renewable energy beyond residential and utility-scale systems. It strengthened my ability to think about decarbonization at a systems level and apply strategic frameworks to emerging clean energy opportunities.

This project strengthened my understanding that decarbonization is not purely a technical challenge. It requires strategic thinking about how emerging technologies can be positioned within existing industries to create both environmental and economic value.
