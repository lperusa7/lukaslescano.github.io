Hi, I’m Lukas Lescano, a fourth-year undergraduate at the University of California, Santa Barbara pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Studies with an emphasis in GIS and Energy & Sustainability.

I’m driven by the challenge of accelerating the clean energy transition through data-informed planning and systems-level thinking. My academic and project work focuses on renewable energy integration, spatial analysis, and strategic approaches to decarbonization.

Growing up with a deep appreciation for natural systems and an interest in how complex systems function, I developed a passion for designing solutions that are both equitable and environmentally sustainable.

I am particularly interested in applying GIS, data analysis, and strategic planning to advance renewable energy deployment and resilient infrastructure.
