    "text": "Hiking has always been an important part of my life. I was introduced to it at a young age through weekend hikes with my family, and it later became a regular activity through trail running during cross country. I’m originally from Aliso Viejo, a city in Orange County, California, where I explored countless trails growing up. Since starting college at the University of California, Santa Barbara, I’ve continued this passion by hiking along the Santa Ynez Mountains and the stunning coastal trails nearby.\nBeyond being a hobby, hiking has long been a therapeutic outlet for me. It gives me space to disconnect from the fast pace of daily life and reconnect with the natural world. There’s something incredibly calming about the steady rhythm of walking and the stillness of a mountain trail. Whether it’s climbing toward a summit or wandering through a coastal bluff, these moments offer clarity, peace, and perspective.\nOne of the most valuable aspects of hiking for me is the escape it provides from screens and constant digital noise. In a world that often feels overstimulated and always online, being out on the trail allows me to be fully present. No pings, no updates—just the sound of my steps and the natural surroundings. It’s in those quiet, unplugged moments that I often feel most grounded.\nThis connection to hiking started early, with frequent hikes alongside my family. Some of my fondest memories come from those outings—sharing stories on the trail or simply enjoying nature in each other’s company. Even now, hiking continues to be a way for me to reflect, recharge, and feel rooted in the present moment.\nBelow, you’ll find an interactive map of hikes I’ve completed both in Southern California and around Santa Barbara. You can also scroll down to see some of my favorite photos from the trail.\n\nMy Top 5 Favorite Hikes\n#1 Top of the World – Laguna Beach, CA\n Difficulty: Moderate\n Sweeping views of the Pacific and the surrounding canyons. A classic from my hometown. A core memory of mine.\n#2 Tangerine Falls – Santa Barbara, CA\n Difficulty: Hard\n A fun, challenging, rocky trail that leads to one of the tallest waterfalls in the area—best after a good rain.\n#3 Crystal Cove Loop – Laguna Beach, CA\n Difficulty: Moderate\n Rolling hills, ocean views, and spring wildflowers—hard to beat.\n#4 Inspiration Point – Santa Barbara, CA\n Difficulty: Moderate\n A go-to for sunrise hikes with an incredible overlook of the coast.\n#5 El Moro Canyon – Laguna Coast Wilderness Park, CA\n Difficulty: Moderate\n Great trail variety and a strong nostalgia factor from childhood hikes.\n\n\n\nHikes Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow are some photos from hikes I’ve done over the years, including two memorable international hikes—one along the coastal ridgeline of Diamond Head in Hawaii, and another through the lush, tropical landscape of El Yunque Rainforest in Puerto Rico.

I wanted to explore this topic because listening to music is a big part of my life and I was curious to dive into the effect that the music genres had on me. To collect my data, after a study session I would gather the following data: Study Period (min), Tasks Completed, Music Genre, Work Environment, Number of Distractions, Time of Day, Amount of Sleep, and Productivity. The productivity variable was a calculated variable. To calculate it I made sure to distinguish the levels of tasks, level 1 to level 5, by the time it should take for a task. These are my judgement before completing the task on how long the task itself should take normally. For example, I level 1 task should take around up to 30 minutes, a level 2 task should take 30 minutes to an hour, a level 3 should take 1-2 hours, and level 4 task should take 2-4 hours, and a level 5 task should take more than 4 hours."

    "text": "I grew up in Orange County, California, where I spent much of my time outdoors, playing sports, hiking, trail running, and spending time at the beach. From a young age, I was constantly asking questions and trying to understand how systems function. That curiosity has evolved into a deep interest in how energy systems, infrastructure, and spatial data shape the world around us.\nI am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Studies at UC Santa Barbara, with an emphasis in GIS and Energy & Sustainability. My academic and project work focuses on renewable energy integration, geospatial analysis, and systems-level approaches to decarbonization. I am particularly interested in how spatial data, strategic planning, and emerging technologies can accelerate the transition toward resilient, low-carbon infrastructure.\nI am drawn to roles that combine technical analysis with structured problem-solving, whether in consulting, energy planning, or project management. I enjoy building clear frameworks, organizing complex information, and working collaboratively to turn ideas into actionable strategies.\nWhat motivates me most is impact. Working in the energy sector is both intellectually challenging and personally meaningful. As someone with family roots in Peru, I have seen firsthand how disparities in energy access can affect quality of life and economic opportunity. In the long term, I hope to contribute to international projects that expand sustainable and reliable energy systems in underserved regions, particularly across Latin America.\nOutside of academics and professional development, I stay active through soccer, hiking, and spending time outdoors. I also value personal growth and continuous improvement, whether through reflective journaling, productivity systems, or exploring ways to optimize how I learn and work. I approach both sustainability and self-development with the same mindset: incremental improvements compound into meaningful long-term change."

    "text": "Project Overview\nFor this project, my colleagues and I designed a residential or commercial solar photovoltaic (PV) system paired with optional battery energy storage (BESS), using Excel modeling and the NREL PVWatts online tool. The objective was to evaluate system performance, electricity bill impacts, and financial viability under California’s Net Energy Metering (NEM) 2.0 policy.\n\n\nSite Selection and Demand Modeling\nFor the location of our project, we selected a real residential site—one of my colleague’s homes in Isla Vista, California. Using the actual annual electricity utility bills, we were able to model the household’s year-round energy demand with realistic assumptions. The system was designed under California’s NEM 2.0 policy, which offers less favorable compensation for excess solar energy exported to the grid. As a result, we optimized the PV system to meet approximately 90–95% of the household’s annual electricity demand, minimizing surplus generation. After refining system parameters and capacity, our final design met 93.84% of the home’s annual energy needs through solar production.\n\n\nModeling Assumptions and Tools\nThe analysis included key parameters such as monthly and hourly electricity demand– explained above–, utility time-of-use (TOU) rates, solar irradiance, and technical specifications for both PV and battery systems. For the Excel model framework, we simulated hourly generation and demand for an entire year, allowing me to assess net electricity imports, state-of-charge (SOC) dynamics, and cost comparisons across scenarios: no solar, solar-only, and solar plus battery storage.\n\n\nBattery Dispatch Logic\nTo model the battery energy storage system (BESS), we followed a simplified dispatch algorithm guided by solar availability, time-of-use (TOU) rates, and system constraints. The battery was programmed to charge only when two conditions were met: (1) there was a solar surplus (generation exceeded demand), and (2) TOU electricity rates were low—typically during off-peak periods. The amount of energy charged was limited by the minimum of three values: the solar surplus available, the battery’s maximum power capacity, and the remaining energy capacity (determined by the difference between the maximum storage limit and the current state of charge).\nSimilarly, the battery was set to discharge only during solar deficits (when demand exceeded solar generation) and during high TOU rate periods—typically from 4 PM to 9 PM. Discharge was capped by the smallest of three limits: the current solar deficit, the battery’s maximum power output, and the existing state of charge. This algorithm allowed us to maximize bill savings by shifting solar energy from low-cost times to high-cost demand periods, while staying within technical and energy constraints. For this exercise, we ignored charging/discharging efficiency losses to keep the model focused on dispatch logic and financial outcomes.\n\n\nKey Outputs and Metrics\nThe final outputs included metrics like percentage of demand met by solar, annual bill savings, levelized cost of energy (LCOE), and simple payback period—providing a holistic view of both the environmental and economic performance of the proposed system.\n\n\nTakeaways and Reflections\nThis project gave me valuable hands-on experience in designing and analyzing distributed solar and battery storage systems. I deepened my understanding of how time-of-use electricity pricing, net metering policies, and system sizing interact to affect both energy performance and economic outcomes. Working with real-world data—from solar irradiance to utility rates—helped me connect technical modeling with policy and financial considerations. Most importantly, the project reinforced the importance of designing systems that are not only efficient, but also aligned with user demand patterns and local market incentives. These skills and insights will be directly applicable to future work in renewable energy planning and sustainable energy solutions.\n\n\nModel Files\nIf you’d like to explore the full data set — including hourly demand, solar generation, and battery behavior — you can download the original Excel model here:\nDownload Full Excel Model (XLSX)\n\n\nPVWatts Results\nBelow, I’ve included the NREL PVWatts Calculator results, which were used to inform several key system assumptions such as solar irradiance, system losses, and annual generation estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{lescano2025,\n  author = {Lescano, Lukas},\n  title = {Solar and {Battery} {Storage} {Design} {Project}},\n  date = {2025-05-02},\n  url = {https://lperusa7.github.io/lukaslescano.github.io/posts/solar_and_battery_storage_design_project/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nLescano, Lukas. 2025. “Solar and Battery Storage Design\nProject.” May 2, 2025. https://lperusa7.github.io/lukaslescano.github.io/posts/solar_and_battery_storage_design_project/."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Project Overview\nAs transportation electrifies, heavy-duty and agricultural equipment remain largely dependent on diesel. This project explores whether Rivian, an EV manufacturer known for sustainable innovation, could accelerate decarbonization in the farming industry through horizontal integration into electric tractors.\nThe objective was to evaluate whether Rivian’s capabilities in battery systems, vertically integrated software, and sustainability branding could translate into a competitive advantage in agricultural machinery.\n\n\nWhy Agriculture Matters in the Energy Transition\nAgriculture remains one of the most diesel-dependent industries globally. Electrifying tractors presents:\n\nEmissions reductions\nLower long-term operating costs\nIntegration with renewable charging infrastructure\nAlignment with ESG and sustainable supply chain goals\n\nThis represents an overlooked frontier in clean energy deployment.\n\n\nReframing the Tractor\nRather than treating the tractor as a mechanical machine, we framed it as:\n\nA mobile energy storage asset\nA connected data platform\nA precision agriculture tool\nA software-defined machine\n\nThis shift from hardware to integrated energy system reflects the broader electrification movement across sectors.\n\n\nStrategic Analysis\nWe applied:\n\nPorter’s Five Forces\nResource-Based View\nValue Chain analysis\n\nto assess industry attractiveness and Rivian’s ability to execute.\nThe analysis revealed:\n\nLow current rivalry in EV tractors\nHigh barriers to entry\nA strong opportunity for first-mover advantage\nRivian’s vertically integrated software stack as a key differentiator\n\n\n\nStrategic Recommendation\nWe recommended a differentiation strategy centered on:\n\nHigh-performance electric tractors\nPrecision agriculture software\nLong-term farm partnerships\nLeveraging government electrification incentives\nEstablishing early market control\n\nThe goal: position Rivian not just as a tractor manufacturer, but as a catalyst for sustainable agriculture.\n\n\nPersonal Reflection\nThis project reflects my interest in renewable energy beyond residential and utility-scale systems. It strengthened my ability to think about decarbonization at a systems level and apply strategic frameworks to emerging clean energy opportunities.\nThis project strengthened my understanding that decarbonization is not purely a technical challenge.

    "title": "Coastal Refill: A Sustainable Retail Business Strategy",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Project Overview\nCoastal Refill is a proposed sustainability-focused retail venture designed to reduce single-use packaging waste through refillable household goods, reusable essentials, and eco-conscious consumer products. Developed as a comprehensive business strategy project, the initiative aimed to evaluate the feasibility of launching a community-centered low-waste store in Santa Barbara and Isla Vista.\nWhile contributing to concept development and organizational structure, I led the financial feasibility analysis, constructing detailed start-up cost estimates, revenue projections, operating expense models, and return-on-investment scenarios to evaluate long-term viability.\n\n\nIdentifying the Opportunity\nSingle-use packaging dominates modern retail, particularly in household cleaning, personal care, and pantry goods. This model generates significant plastic waste and unnecessary emissions throughout the product life cycle. At the same time, consumer awareness of environmental impact continues to rise, particularly in sustainability-driven communities like Santa Barbara and Isla Vista.\nCoastal Refill was conceptualized to address this gap by introducing a refill-based retail model that reduces packaging waste while maintaining competitive pricing and product quality. By analyzing local demographics, consumer behavior trends, and sustainability culture in the region, we identified an opportunity to align environmental responsibility with a financially viable small-business model.\n\n\nBusiness Model & Value Proposition\nCoastal Refill was designed around a refill-by-weight retail model, offering household cleaning products, personal care items, and pantry staples in bulk to minimize single-use packaging. Customers would purchase reusable containers or bring their own, paying only for the product volume dispensed. Complementary revenue streams included sustainable lifestyle goods and reusable household essentials.\nThe value proposition centered on three pillars: affordability over time, measurable waste reduction, and community-based sustainability. By reducing packaging costs and sourcing in bulk, the model aimed to offer competitive pricing while maintaining healthy margins. A loyalty program and campus partnerships were incorporated to build recurring customer relationships and encourage long-term behavioral shifts toward low-waste consumption.\nRather than competing solely on price, Coastal Refill differentiated itself through transparency, mission-driven branding, and local engagement, positioning sustainability not as a premium niche but as an accessible everyday choice.\n\n\nFinancial Feasibility & Capital Strategy\nTo evaluate the viability of Coastal Refill, I developed a detailed financial model assessing start-up capital requirements, operating expenses, revenue projections, and long-term return potential.\nStart-up costs were estimated between approximately $47,000 and $60,000, including lease deposits, inventory procurement, store build-out, equipment, insurance, and initial marketing. Fixed costs such as rent and utilities were modeled alongside variable costs tied to inventory turnover and restocking frequency.\nRevenue projections were constructed under conservative, moderate, and optimistic demand scenarios, incorporating product mix assumptions and pricing strategy. Based on these projections, the business was expected to reach break-even in Year 3, with cumulative profitability exceeding $70,000 by Year 5 under steady 15–20% annual growth.\nThis financial analysis translated the sustainability vision into measurable economic outcomes, ensuring the venture balanced environmental impact with operational realism.\n\n\nSustainability & Community Impact\nCoastal Refill was designed to function as more than a retail store; it was conceptualized as a localized systems intervention in everyday consumption patterns. By shifting purchasing behavior toward refill and reuse models, the venture aimed to reduce single-use packaging waste at the household level while promoting more circular consumption habits.\nBeyond environmental impact, the model emphasized community engagement. The proposed Isla Vista location leveraged walkability and student accessibility, while loyalty programs and campus partnerships were designed to foster recurring participation in low-waste practices. By embedding sustainability within daily routines, Coastal Refill sought to normalize environmentally responsible consumption rather than position it as a niche alternative.\nIn this way, the project demonstrated how small-scale, community-centered businesses can contribute to broader sustainability transitions while remaining financially grounded.\n\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nMission-driven ventures require disciplined financial validation to remain viable long-term.\nSustainable retail models must balance environmental impact with operational efficiency and margin structure.\nCommunity engagement can function as a structural competitive advantage rather than simply a marketing tool.\nEarly-stage capital planning and scenario modeling significantly reduce venture risk.\nBehavioral change at the local level can contribute meaningfully to broader sustainability transitions.\n\n\n\nDeliverable\nThe complete business plan includes detailed market research, operational strategy, financial modeling, five-year projections, and implementation planning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteCoastal Refill – Full Business Plan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{lescano2025,\n  author = {Lescano, Lukas},\n  title = {Coastal {Refill:} {A} {Sustainable} {Retail} {Business}\n    {Strategy}},\n  date = {2025-07-31},\n  url = {https://lperusa7.github.io/lukaslescano.github.io/posts/coastal_refill_business_plan/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nLescano, Lukas. 2025. “Coastal Refill: A Sustainable Retail\nBusiness Strategy.” July 31, 2025. https://lperusa7.github.io/lukaslescano.github.io/posts/coastal_refill_business_plan/."

    "section": "Modeling Framework",
    "text": "Modeling Framework\nThe wildfire risk model was structured as a multi-criteria spatial framework integrating three core dimensions of risk:\n\nVegetation Susceptibility: Fuel type plays a central role in wildfire behavior. Using historical wildfire perimeters and vegetation classification data, vegetation types were ranked based on the proportion of area previously burned. This produced a vegetation risk surface representing relative fuel vulnerability across the county.\nClimatic Exposure (Wind & Precipitation): Wind intensity and precipitation patterns influence fire spread potential and fuel dryness. These raster layers were reclassified into standardized risk categories and combined to generate a weather-based exposure surface.\nEmergency Response Accessibility: Response time significantly affects suppression effectiveness. Areas located farther from fire stations face increased risk due to delayed containment. This component was modeled using network analysis to estimate travel-time accessibility.\n\nEach of these layers was processed independently and standardized before integration. The final wildfire risk surface was generated through weighted raster analysis, allowing environmental and infrastructure-based factors to be evaluated simultaneously within a unified spatial framework."

Travel time, measured in minutes, was defined as the cost structure rather than straight-line distance to better reflect realistic emergency response conditions. Fire engines were assumed to travel at an average speed of 45 mph.\nService areas were generated around each fire station using the following time cutoffs (minutes):\n\n0, 10, 20, 30, 50, 75, 100, and 150\n\nThese intervals produced overlapping response-time polygons representing incremental accessibility zones.\n\n\nProcessing & Risk Classification\nBecause service areas from multiple stations overlapped, further processing was required to assign each location a single minimum response-time value. The service areas were converted into ranked polygon layers and processed iteratively to remove overlaps, preserving only the shortest available response time for each area.\nA response-time risk ranking was then assigned:\n\n0–10 minutes → Risk Rank 1 (Lowest Risk)\n10–20 minutes → Risk Rank 2\n20–30 minutes → Risk Rank 3\n30–50 minutes → Risk Rank 4\n50–75 minutes → Risk Rank 5\n75–100 minutes → Risk Rank 6\n100–150 minutes → Risk Rank 7 (Highest Risk)\n\nLonger travel times were classified as higher risk due to delayed suppression capacity and increased opportunity for fire spread.\n\n\nOutput\nThe final output was a non-overlapping fire response accessibility layer representing the minimum achievable response time across the county. This layer was subsequently converted to raster format and integrated into the weighted wildfire risk model."

    "text": "Weighted Raster Integration\nFollowing the independent development of each risk component, the Vegetation Risk, Fire Response Risk, and Wind & Precipitation Risk layers were integrated into a single composite wildfire risk surface using raster-based multi-criteria analysis.\nBefore integration, all layers were projected into a common coordinate system, standardized to the same cell size, and aligned using a shared snap raster to ensure spatial consistency. The Fire Response Risk layer, originally generated as vector polygons, was converted to raster format to allow pixel-level analysis within the Raster Calculator.\n\nWeighting Strategy\nTo determine appropriate weighting, historical wildfire perimeter data were used as a reference layer to visually assess spatial agreement with each risk surface. Both the Vegetation Risk and Fire Response Risk layers demonstrated strong correspondence with past burn patterns:\n\nThe Vegetation Risk layer captured fuel types with historically higher burn proportions.\nThe Fire Response Risk layer highlighted areas where extended travel times may have contributed to larger or more difficult-to-control fires.\n\nIn contrast, the combined Wind and Precipitation layer exhibited less spatial variability and weaker alignment with historical fire extents.\nBased on this evaluation, the following weighting scheme was applied in the Raster Calculator:\n\nVegetation Risk × 2\nFire Response Risk × 2\nWind & Precipitation Risk × 1\n\nThis 2:2:1 weighting structure reflects the greater explanatory relevance of fuel conditions and emergency accessibility relative to climatic variability in the context of observed fire history.\nThe resulting weighted raster represents the combined influence of environmental susceptibility and response-time disparities, producing a spatially differentiated wildfire risk surface across Santa Barbara County."

    "text": "Key Findings\nThe final weighted wildfire risk surface revealed spatial patterns driven by both environmental fuel conditions and emergency response accessibility.\nHigh-risk zones were concentrated in areas characterized by burn-prone vegetation types combined with extended response times from fire stations. In particular, regions located farther from established fire infrastructure exhibited elevated composite risk values, even when climatic factors remained moderate. This underscores the importance of emergency accessibility as a contributing factor in wildfire vulnerability.\nUrban-adjacent areas with shorter travel times generally displayed lower composite risk rankings, reflecting the moderating influence of rapid suppression capacity. However, transitional zones between developed and wildland areas emerged as critical areas of concern, where combustible vegetation and delayed response intersect.\nThe weighting strategy reinforced the significance of vegetation susceptibility and response-time disparities in shaping the final risk distribution. While wind and precipitation contributed to overall variability, they demonstrated less differentiating power relative to fuel and accessibility factors.\nOverall, the model highlights how infrastructure distribution and land cover conditions interact to produce spatially uneven wildfire risk across Santa Barbara County. These findings emphasize the importance of incorporating emergency response accessibility into regional hazard planning frameworks."

    "section": "Model Limitations & Model Framing",
    "text": "Model Limitations & Model Framing\nWhile the final wildfire risk map provides a structured spatial assessment of vulnerability across Santa Barbara County, an important conceptual distinction emerged during the modeling process: wildfire risk is not a single phenomenon, but can represent different stages of fire dynamics.\nThe model developed in this project most closely reflects wildfire spread risk, rather than ignition probability. The weighting scheme emphasized vegetation susceptibility and emergency response accessibility, highlighting areas where fuel conditions and delayed suppression capacity may allow fires to expand more rapidly once ignited.\nHowever, if the objective were to model wildfire ignition risk, the analytical framework would differ. An ignition-focused model would prioritize variables that influence fire start probability, such as:\n\nVegetation and fuel type\nFuel moisture\nPrecipitation deficits\nSlope and topography\nHuman infrastructure or ignition sources\n\nIn contrast, a spread-focused model would emphasize:\n\nWind exposure\nEmergency response time\nRoad accessibility\nFuel continuity\nTerrain features influencing fire behavior\n\nThis distinction suggests that the current workflow could be separated into two independent modeling frameworks, each calibrated with its own weighting structure and validation approach. Such separation would improve clarity of purpose and allow for more precise risk communication.\nAdditionally, the applied 2:2:1 weighting scheme was heuristic rather than statistically calibrated. Although informed by visual comparison with historical fire perimeters, future iterations could incorporate spatial autocorrelation tests, hotspot analysis, or sensitivity analysis to quantitatively validate weighting decisions.\nData integration also posed technical challenges. Raster and vector datasets from multiple sources required careful projection alignment, cell-size standardization, and overlap resolution. Intersecting wildfire perimeters with vegetation layers introduced potential duplication of burned areas due to overlapping fire histories, requiring cautious interpretation.\nFuture improvements could include incorporating slope, fuel moisture, and additional climatic indices, as well as performing formal model validation against past fire spread patterns.\nDespite these limitations, the project demonstrates how multi-criteria spatial analysis can integrate environmental and infrastructure-based variables into decision-support tools for hazard planning."
