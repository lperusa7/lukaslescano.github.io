    "text": "Hiking has always been an important part of my life. I was introduced to it at a young age through weekend hikes with my family, and it later became a regular activity through trail running during cross country. Iâ€™m originally from Aliso Viejo, a city in Orange County, California, where I explored countless trails growing up. Since starting college at the University of California, Santa Barbara, Iâ€™ve continued this passion by hiking along the Santa Ynez Mountains and the stunning coastal trails nearby.\nBeyond being a hobby, hiking has long been a therapeutic outlet for me. It gives me space to disconnect from the fast pace of daily life and reconnect with the natural world. Thereâ€™s something incredibly calming about the steady rhythm of walking and the stillness of a mountain trail. Whether itâ€™s climbing toward a summit or wandering through a coastal bluff, these moments offer clarity, peace, and perspective.\nOne of the most valuable aspects of hiking for me is the escape it provides from screens and constant digital noise. In a world that often feels overstimulated and always online, being out on the trail allows me to be fully present. No pings, no updatesâ€”just the sound of my steps and the natural surroundings. Itâ€™s in those quiet, unplugged moments that I often feel most grounded.\nThis connection to hiking started early, with frequent hikes alongside my family. Some of my fondest memories come from those outingsâ€”sharing stories on the trail or simply enjoying nature in each otherâ€™s company. Even now, hiking continues to be a way for me to reflect, recharge, and feel rooted in the present moment.\nBelow, youâ€™ll find an interactive map of hikes Iâ€™ve completed both in Southern California and around Santa Barbara. You can also scroll down to see some of my favorite photos from the trail.\n\n\nðŸŒŸ My Top 5 Favorite Hikes\n#1 Top of the World â€“ Laguna Beach, CA\nâ€ƒDifficulty: Moderate\nâ€ƒSweeping views of the Pacific and the surrounding canyons. A classic from my hometown. A core memory of mine.\n#2 Tangerine Falls â€“ Santa Barbara, CA\nâ€ƒDifficulty: Hard\nâ€ƒA fun, challenging, rocky trail that leads to one of the tallest waterfalls in the areaâ€”best after a good rain.\n#3 Crystal Cove Loop â€“ Laguna Beach, CA\nâ€ƒDifficulty: Moderate\nâ€ƒRolling hills, ocean views, and spring wildflowersâ€”hard to beat.\n#4 Inspiration Point â€“ Santa Barbara, CA\nâ€ƒDifficulty: Moderate\nâ€ƒA go-to for sunrise hikes with an incredible overlook of the coast.\n#5 El Moro Canyon â€“ Laguna Coast Wilderness Park, CA\nâ€ƒDifficulty: Moderate\nâ€ƒGreat trail variety and a strong nostalgia factor from childhood hikes.\n\n\n\nðŸ—º Hikes Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow are some photos from hikes Iâ€™ve done over the years, including two memorable international hikesâ€”one along the coastal ridgeline of Diamond Head in Hawaii, and another through the lush, tropical landscape of El Yunque Rainforest in Puerto Rico. Each of these trails offered a unique perspective and remains a highlight of my hiking experiences.\n\n\nðŸ¥¾ El Yunque â€“ Puerto Rico\nA hike through lush tropical rainforest with waterfalls and mountain views.\n\n     \n\n\n\nðŸŒ‹ Diamond Head â€“ Hawaii\nA popular coastal hike that climbs along the edge of a volcanic crater, offering panoramic views of Honolulu and the Pacific Ocean.\n\n     \n\n\n\nðŸŒ„ Top of the World â€“ Aliso Viejo, CA\nA hometown favorite with sweeping views of Orange County and the coastlineâ€”especially beautiful at sunset.\n\n  \n\n\n\nðŸ’§ Tangerine Falls â€“ Santa Barbara, CA\nA fun, challenging, rocky trail that leads to one of the tallest waterfalls in the areaâ€”best after a good rain.\n\n  \n\n\n\nðŸŒ² Black Star Canyon â€“ Orange County, CA\nA rugged backcountry trail known for its dramatic canyon walls, creek crossings, and a bit of local legend and history."

    "text": "Hi everyone! Iâ€™m Lukas Lescano, a third-year undergraduate at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Iâ€™m pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Studies with an emphasis in Energy and Sustainability. Iâ€™m passionate about the clean energy transition and the path toward decarbonizing the electricity sector.\nGrowing up with a deep appreciation for nature and a curiosity about how systems work, I became committed to helping build a more sustainable and equitable energy future.\nIâ€™m especially interested in technology and systems planning, and I aim to work on scalable solutions for renewable energy integration and sustainable infrastructure."

    "text": "In this project I explored how my productivity levels changed based on the music genre I listened to. I wanted to explore this topic because listening to music is a big part of my life and I was curious to dive into the effect that the music genres had on me. To collect my data, after a study session I would gather the following data: Study Period (min), Tasks Completed, Music Genre, Work Environment, Number of Distractions, Time of Day, Amount of Sleep, and Productivity. The productivity variable was a calculated variable. To calculate it I made sure to distinguish the levels of tasks, level 1 to level 5, by the time it should take for a task. These are my judgement before completing the task on how long the task itself should take normally. For example, I level 1 task should take around up to 30 minutes, a level 2 task should take 30 minutes to an hour, a level 3 should take 1-2 hours, and level 4 task should take 2-4 hours, and a level 5 task should take more than 4 hours."

    "text": "I grew up in Orange County, California, where I spent most of my time outdoorsâ€”playing sports, hiking, trail running, and spending time at the beach. I was always a curious kid, constantly asking questions and trying to understand how things work. That same curiosity drives me today as I dive deep into topics like renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency.\nBelow I have included a plethora of hikes in Santa Barbara and around Orange County, my hometown:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt UCSB, Iâ€™m majoring in Environmental Studies with an emphasis in Energy and Sustainability. Iâ€™m especially interested in systems-level solutions for decarbonizing the electricity sectorâ€”like wind, solar, and battery storageâ€”and I hope to build a career in consulting and project management in the clean energy space. I stay active on campus by participating in intramural soccer leagues, which keep me connected to my love for team sports and help balance my academic life.\nIâ€™ve always loved working in teams, both in recreational and professional settings. Whether itâ€™s collaborating on a group project or hexlping lead the execution of a larger team effort, I enjoy creating structured plans and helping others execute them effectively.\nWhat motivates me most is impact. I believe working in the energy sector is not only intellectually rewarding, but also deeply fulfilling. As someone with family roots in Peru, Iâ€™ve seen the disparities in energy access and quality of life firsthand. One of my long-term goals is to work on international projects that help communitiesâ€”especially in places like Peruâ€”benefit from sustainable and resilient energy systems.\nOutside of academics, Iâ€™m usually on the soccer field, exploring a new trail, spending time at the beach, or catching the sunset with my friends. Iâ€™m also really into personal developmentâ€”whether thatâ€™s listening to lifestyle and productivity podcasts, journaling to reflect and set goals, tracking my habits, or experimenting with new ways to optimize my daily routine. I enjoy the process of self-improvement just as much as I enjoy learning about how we can build smarter, more sustainable systems."
