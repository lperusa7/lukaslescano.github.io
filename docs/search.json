As previously mentioned I’m from a city called Aliso Viejo, California which is in Orange County. During my times before university I’ve done a large amount of hikes within my area, and during my time at the University of California Santa Barbara, I have done many hikes along the Santa Ynez mountains as well as some beach trails.\nBelow I have included a plethora of hikes in Santa Barbara and around Orange County, my hometown:"

    "text": "Hi everyone! I’m Lukas Lescano, a third-year undergraduate at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I’m pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Studies with an emphasis in Energy and Sustainability. I’m passionate about the clean energy transition and the path toward decarbonizing the electricity sector.\nGrowing up with a deep appreciation for nature and a curiosity about how systems work, I became committed to helping build a more sustainable and equitable energy future.\nI’m especially interested in technology and systems planning, and I aim to work on scalable solutions for renewable energy integration and sustainable infrastructure."

    "text": "In this project I explored how my productivity levels changed based on the music genre I listened to. I wanted to explore this topic because listening to music is a big part of my life and I was curious to dive into the effect that the music genres had on me. To collect my data, after a study session I would gather the following data: Study Period (min), Tasks Completed, Music Genre, Work Environment, Number of Distractions, Time of Day, Amount of Sleep, and Productivity. The productivity variable was a calculated variable. To calculate it I made sure to distinguish the levels of tasks, level 1 to level 5, by the time it should take for a task. These are my judgement before completing the task on how long the task itself should take normally. For example, I level 1 task should take around up to 30 minutes, a level 2 task should take 30 minutes to an hour, a level 3 should take 1-2 hours, and level 4 task should take 2-4 hours, and a level 5 task should take more than 4 hours."

    "text": "I grew up in Orange County, California, where I spent most of my time outdoors—playing sports, hiking, trail running, and spending time at the beach. I was always a curious kid, constantly asking questions and trying to understand how things work. That same curiosity drives me today as I dive deep into topics like renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency.\nBelow I have included a plethora of hikes in Santa Barbara and around Orange County, my hometown:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt UCSB, I’m majoring in Environmental Studies with an emphasis in Energy and Sustainability. I’m especially interested in systems-level solutions for decarbonizing the electricity sector—like wind, solar, and battery storage—and I hope to build a career in consulting and project management in the clean energy space. I stay active on campus by participating in intramural soccer leagues, which keep me connected to my love for team sports and help balance my academic life.\nI’ve always loved working in teams, both in recreational and professional settings. Whether it’s collaborating on a group project or hexlping lead the execution of a larger team effort, I enjoy creating structured plans and helping others execute them effectively.\nWhat motivates me most is impact. I believe working in the energy sector is not only intellectually rewarding, but also deeply fulfilling. As someone with family roots in Peru, I’ve seen the disparities in energy access and quality of life firsthand. One of my long-term goals is to work on international projects that help communities—especially in places like Peru—benefit from sustainable and resilient energy systems.\nOutside of academics, I’m usually on the soccer field, exploring a new trail, spending time at the beach, or catching the sunset with my friends. I’m also really into personal development—whether that’s listening to lifestyle and productivity podcasts, journaling to reflect and set goals, tracking my habits, or experimenting with new ways to optimize my daily routine. I enjoy the process of self-improvement just as much as I enjoy learning about how we can build smarter, more sustainable systems."
