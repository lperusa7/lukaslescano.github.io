    "text": "Hiking has always been an important part of my life. I was introduced to it at a young age through weekend hikes with my family, and it later became a regular activity through trail running during cross country. I’m originally from Aliso Viejo, a city in Orange County, California, where I explored countless trails growing up. Since starting college at the University of California, Santa Barbara, I’ve continued this passion by hiking along the Santa Ynez Mountains and the stunning coastal trails nearby.\nBeyond being a hobby, hiking has long been a therapeutic outlet for me. It gives me space to disconnect from the fast pace of daily life and reconnect with the natural world. There’s something incredibly calming about the steady rhythm of walking and the stillness of a mountain trail. Whether it’s climbing toward a summit or wandering through a coastal bluff, these moments offer clarity, peace, and perspective.\nOne of the most valuable aspects of hiking for me is the escape it provides from screens and constant digital noise. In a world that often feels overstimulated and always online, being out on the trail allows me to be fully present. No pings, no updates—just the sound of my steps and the natural surroundings. It’s in those quiet, unplugged moments that I often feel most grounded.\nThis connection to hiking started early, with frequent hikes alongside my family. Some of my fondest memories come from those outings—sharing stories on the trail or simply enjoying nature in each other’s company. Even now, hiking continues to be a way for me to reflect, recharge, and feel rooted in the present moment.\nBelow, you’ll find an interactive map of hikes I’ve completed both in Southern California and around Santa Barbara. You can also scroll down to see some of my favorite photos from the trail.\n\nMy Top 5 Favorite Hikes\n#1 Top of the World – Laguna Beach, CA\n Difficulty: Moderate\n Sweeping views of the Pacific and the surrounding canyons. A classic from my hometown. A core memory of mine.\n#2 Tangerine Falls – Santa Barbara, CA\n Difficulty: Hard\n A fun, challenging, rocky trail that leads to one of the tallest waterfalls in the area—best after a good rain.\n#3 Crystal Cove Loop – Laguna Beach, CA\n Difficulty: Moderate\n Rolling hills, ocean views, and spring wildflowers—hard to beat.\n#4 Inspiration Point – Santa Barbara, CA\n Difficulty: Moderate\n A go-to for sunrise hikes with an incredible overlook of the coast.\n#5 El Moro Canyon – Laguna Coast Wilderness Park, CA\n Difficulty: Moderate\n Great trail variety and a strong nostalgia factor from childhood hikes.\n\n\n\nHikes Map\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow are some photos from hikes I’ve done over the years, including two memorable international hikes—one along the coastal ridgeline of Diamond Head in Hawaii, and another through the lush, tropical landscape of El Yunque Rainforest in Puerto Rico. Each of these trails offered a unique perspective and remains a highlight of my hiking experiences.\n\n\nEl Yunque – Puerto Rico\nA hike through lush tropical rainforest with waterfalls and mountain views.\n\n     \n\n\n\nDiamond Head – Hawaii\nA popular coastal hike that climbs along the edge of a volcanic crater, offering panoramic views of Honolulu and the Pacific Ocean.\n\n     \n\n\n\nTop of the World – Aliso Viejo, CA\nA hometown favorite with sweeping views of Orange County and the coastline—especially beautiful at sunset.\n\n  \n\n\n\nTangerine Falls – Santa Barbara, CA\nA fun, challenging, rocky trail that leads to one of the tallest waterfalls in the area—best after a good rain.\n\n  \n\n\n\nBlack Star Canyon – Orange County, CA\nA rugged backcountry trail known for its dramatic canyon walls, creek crossings, and a bit of local legend and history."

I wanted to explore this topic because listening to music is a big part of my life and I was curious to dive into the effect that the music genres had on me. To collect my data, after a study session I would gather the following data: Study Period (min), Tasks Completed, Music Genre, Work Environment, Number of Distractions, Time of Day, Amount of Sleep, and Productivity. The productivity variable was a calculated variable. To calculate it I made sure to distinguish the levels of tasks, level 1 to level 5, by the time it should take for a task. These are my judgement before completing the task on how long the task itself should take normally. For example, I level 1 task should take around up to 30 minutes, a level 2 task should take 30 minutes to an hour, a level 3 should take 1-2 hours, and level 4 task should take 2-4 hours, and a level 5 task should take more than 4 hours."

    "text": "I grew up in Orange County, California, where I spent much of my time outdoors, playing sports, hiking, trail running, and spending time at the beach. From a young age, I was constantly asking questions and trying to understand how systems function. That curiosity has evolved into a deep interest in how energy systems, infrastructure, and spatial data shape the world around us.\nI am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Studies at UC Santa Barbara, with an emphasis in GIS and Energy & Sustainability. My academic and project work focuses on renewable energy integration, geospatial analysis, and systems-level approaches to decarbonization. I am particularly interested in how spatial data, strategic planning, and emerging technologies can accelerate the transition toward resilient, low-carbon infrastructure.\nI am drawn to roles that combine technical analysis with structured problem-solving, whether in consulting, energy planning, or project management. I enjoy building clear frameworks, organizing complex information, and working collaboratively to turn ideas into actionable strategies.\nWhat motivates me most is impact. Working in the energy sector is both intellectually challenging and personally meaningful. As someone with family roots in Peru, I have seen firsthand how disparities in energy access can affect quality of life and economic opportunity. In the long term, I hope to contribute to international projects that expand sustainable and reliable energy systems in underserved regions, particularly across Latin America.\nOutside of academics and professional development, I stay active through soccer, hiking, and spending time outdoors. I also value personal growth and continuous improvement, whether through reflective journaling, productivity systems, or exploring ways to optimize how I learn and work. I approach both sustainability and self-development with the same mindset: incremental improvements compound into meaningful long-term change."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Project Overview\nFor this project, my colleagues and I designed a residential or commercial solar photovoltaic (PV) system paired with optional battery energy storage (BESS), using Excel modeling and the NREL PVWatts online tool. The objective was to evaluate system performance, electricity bill impacts, and financial viability under California’s Net Energy Metering (NEM) 2.0 policy.\n\n\nSite Selection and Demand Modeling\nFor the location of our project, we selected a real residential site—one of my colleague’s homes in Isla Vista, California. Using the actual annual electricity utility bills, we were able to model the household’s year-round energy demand with realistic assumptions. The system was designed under California’s NEM 2.0 policy, which offers less favorable compensation for excess solar energy exported to the grid. As a result, we optimized the PV system to meet approximately 90–95% of the household’s annual electricity demand, minimizing surplus generation. After refining system parameters and capacity, our final design met 93.84% of the home’s annual energy needs through solar production.\n\n\nModeling Assumptions and Tools\nThe analysis included key parameters such as monthly and hourly electricity demand– explained above–, utility time-of-use (TOU) rates, solar irradiance, and technical specifications for both PV and battery systems. For the Excel model framework, we simulated hourly generation and demand for an entire year, allowing me to assess net electricity imports, state-of-charge (SOC) dynamics, and cost comparisons across scenarios: no solar, solar-only, and solar plus battery storage.\n\n\nBattery Dispatch Logic\nTo model the battery energy storage system (BESS), we followed a simplified dispatch algorithm guided by solar availability, time-of-use (TOU) rates, and system constraints. The battery was programmed to charge only when two conditions were met: (1) there was a solar surplus (generation exceeded demand), and (2) TOU electricity rates were low—typically during off-peak periods. The amount of energy charged was limited by the minimum of three values: the solar surplus available, the battery’s maximum power capacity, and the remaining energy capacity (determined by the difference between the maximum storage limit and the current state of charge).\nSimilarly, the battery was set to discharge only during solar deficits (when demand exceeded solar generation) and during high TOU rate periods—typically from 4 PM to 9 PM. Discharge was capped by the smallest of three limits: the current solar deficit, the battery’s maximum power output, and the existing state of charge. This algorithm allowed us to maximize bill savings by shifting solar energy from low-cost times to high-cost demand periods, while staying within technical and energy constraints. For this exercise, we ignored charging/discharging efficiency losses to keep the model focused on dispatch logic and financial outcomes.\n\n\nKey Outputs and Metrics\nThe final outputs included metrics like percentage of demand met by solar, annual bill savings, levelized cost of energy (LCOE), and simple payback period—providing a holistic view of both the environmental and economic performance of the proposed system.\n\n\nTakeaways and Reflections\nThis project gave me valuable hands-on experience in designing and analyzing distributed solar and battery storage systems. I deepened my understanding of how time-of-use electricity pricing, net metering policies, and system sizing interact to affect both energy performance and economic outcomes. Working with real-world data—from solar irradiance to utility rates—helped me connect technical modeling with policy and financial considerations. Most importantly, the project reinforced the importance of designing systems that are not only efficient, but also aligned with user demand patterns and local market incentives. These skills and insights will be directly applicable to future work in renewable energy planning and sustainable energy solutions.\n\n\nModel Files\nIf you’d like to explore the full data set — including hourly demand, solar generation, and battery behavior — you can download the original Excel model here:\nDownload Full Excel Model (XLSX)\n\n\nPVWatts Results\nBelow, I’ve included the NREL PVWatts Calculator results, which were used to inform several key system assumptions such as solar irradiance, system losses, and annual generation estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{lescano2025,\n  author = {Lescano, Lukas},\n  title = {Solar and {Battery} {Storage} {Design} {Project}},\n  date = {2025-05-02},\n  url = {https://lperusa7.github.io/lukaslescano.github.io/posts/solar_and_battery_storage_design_project/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nLescano, Lukas. 2025. “Solar and Battery Storage Design\nProject.” May 2, 2025. https://lperusa7.github.io/lukaslescano.github.io/posts/solar_and_battery_storage_design_project/."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Project Overview\nAs transportation electrifies, heavy-duty and agricultural equipment remain largely dependent on diesel. This project explores whether Rivian, an EV manufacturer known for sustainable innovation, could accelerate decarbonization in the farming industry through horizontal integration into electric tractors.\nThe objective was to evaluate whether Rivian’s capabilities in battery systems, vertically integrated software, and sustainability branding could translate into a competitive advantage in agricultural machinery.\n\n\nWhy Agriculture Matters in the Energy Transition\nAgriculture remains one of the most diesel-dependent industries globally.

    "title": "Coastal Refill: A Sustainable Retail Business Strategy",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Project Overview\nCoastal Refill is a proposed sustainability-focused retail venture designed to reduce single-use packaging waste through refillable household goods, reusable essentials, and eco-conscious consumer products. Developed as a comprehensive business strategy project, the initiative aimed to evaluate the feasibility of launching a community-centered low-waste store in Santa Barbara and Isla Vista.\nWhile contributing to concept development and organizational structure, I led the financial feasibility analysis, constructing detailed start-up cost estimates, revenue projections, operating expense models, and return-on-investment scenarios to evaluate long-term viability.\n\n\nIdentifying the Opportunity\nSingle-use packaging dominates modern retail, particularly in household cleaning, personal care, and pantry goods. This model generates significant plastic waste and unnecessary emissions throughout the product life cycle. At the same time, consumer awareness of environmental impact continues to rise, particularly in sustainability-driven communities like Santa Barbara and Isla Vista.\nCoastal Refill was conceptualized to address this gap by introducing a refill-based retail model that reduces packaging waste while maintaining competitive pricing and product quality. By analyzing local demographics, consumer behavior trends, and sustainability culture in the region, we identified an opportunity to align environmental responsibility with a financially viable small-business model.\n\n\nBusiness Model & Value Proposition\nCoastal Refill was designed around a refill-by-weight retail model, offering household cleaning products, personal care items, and pantry staples in bulk to minimize single-use packaging. Customers would purchase reusable containers or bring their own, paying only for the product volume dispensed. Complementary revenue streams included sustainable lifestyle goods and reusable household essentials.\nThe value proposition centered on three pillars: affordability over time, measurable waste reduction, and community-based sustainability. By reducing packaging costs and sourcing in bulk, the model aimed to offer competitive pricing while maintaining healthy margins. A loyalty program and campus partnerships were incorporated to build recurring customer relationships and encourage long-term behavioral shifts toward low-waste consumption.\nRather than competing solely on price, Coastal Refill differentiated itself through transparency, mission-driven branding, and local engagement, positioning sustainability not as a premium niche but as an accessible everyday choice.\n\n\nFinancial Feasibility & Capital Strategy\nTo evaluate the viability of Coastal Refill, I developed a detailed financial model assessing start-up capital requirements, operating expenses, revenue projections, and long-term return potential.\nStart-up costs were estimated between approximately $47,000 and $60,000, including lease deposits, inventory procurement, store build-out, equipment, insurance, and initial marketing. Fixed costs such as rent and utilities were modeled alongside variable costs tied to inventory turnover and restocking frequency.\nRevenue projections were constructed under conservative, moderate, and optimistic demand scenarios, incorporating product mix assumptions and pricing strategy. Based on these projections, the business was expected to reach break-even in Year 3, with cumulative profitability exceeding $70,000 by Year 5 under steady 15–20% annual growth.\nThis financial analysis translated the sustainability vision into measurable economic outcomes, ensuring the venture balanced environmental impact with operational realism.\n\n\nSustainability & Community Impact\nCoastal Refill was designed to function as more than a retail store; it was conceptualized as a localized systems intervention in everyday consumption patterns. By shifting purchasing behavior toward refill and reuse models, the venture aimed to reduce single-use packaging waste at the household level while promoting more circular consumption habits.\nBeyond environmental impact, the model emphasized community engagement. The proposed Isla Vista location leveraged walkability and student accessibility, while loyalty programs and campus partnerships were designed to foster recurring participation in low-waste practices. By embedding sustainability within daily routines, Coastal Refill sought to normalize environmentally responsible consumption rather than position it as a niche alternative.\nIn this way, the project demonstrated how small-scale, community-centered businesses can contribute to broader sustainability transitions while remaining financially grounded.\n\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nMission-driven ventures require disciplined financial validation to remain viable long-term.\nSustainable retail models must balance environmental impact with operational efficiency and margin structure.\nCommunity engagement can function as a structural competitive advantage rather than simply a marketing tool.\nEarly-stage capital planning and scenario modeling significantly reduce venture risk.\nBehavioral change at the local level can contribute meaningfully to broader sustainability transitions.\n\n\n\nDeliverable\nThe complete business plan includes detailed market research, operational strategy, financial modeling, five-year projections, and implementation planning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteCoastal Refill – Full Business Plan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{lescano2025,\n  author = {Lescano, Lukas},\n  title = {Coastal {Refill:} {A} {Sustainable} {Retail} {Business}\n    {Strategy}},\n  date = {2025-07-31},\n  url = {https://lperusa7.github.io/lukaslescano.github.io/posts/coastal_refill_business_plan/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nLescano, Lukas. 2025. “Coastal Refill: A Sustainable Retail\nBusiness Strategy.” July 31, 2025. https://lperusa7.github.io/lukaslescano.github.io/posts/coastal_refill_business_plan/."
