    "text": "Hiking has always been an important part of my life. I was introduced to it at a young age through weekend hikes with my family, and it later became a regular activity through trail running during cross country. I’m originally from Aliso Viejo, a city in Orange County, California, where I explored countless trails growing up. Since starting college at the University of California, Santa Barbara, I’ve continued this passion by hiking along the Santa Ynez Mountains and the stunning coastal trails nearby.\nBeyond being a hobby, hiking has long been a therapeutic outlet for me. It gives me space to disconnect from the fast pace of daily life and reconnect with the natural world. There’s something incredibly calming about the steady rhythm of walking and the stillness of a mountain trail. Whether it’s climbing toward a summit or wandering through a coastal bluff, these moments offer clarity, peace, and perspective.\nOne of the most valuable aspects of hiking for me is the escape it provides from screens and constant digital noise. In a world that often feels overstimulated and always online, being out on the trail allows me to be fully present. No pings, no updates—just the sound of my steps and the natural surroundings. It’s in those quiet, unplugged moments that I often feel most grounded.\nThis connection to hiking started early, with frequent hikes alongside my family. Some of my fondest memories come from those outings—sharing stories on the trail or simply enjoying nature in each other’s company. Even now, hiking continues to be a way for me to reflect, recharge, and feel rooted in the present moment.\nBelow, you’ll find an interactive map of hikes I’ve completed both in Southern California and around Santa Barbara. You can also scroll down to see some of my favorite photos from the trail.\n\n\n🌟 My Top 5 Favorite Hikes\n#1 Top of the World – Laguna Beach, CA\n Difficulty: Moderate\n Sweeping views of the Pacific and the surrounding canyons.

    "text": "In this project I explored how my productivity levels changed based on the music genre I listened to. I wanted to explore this topic because listening to music is a big part of my life and I was curious to dive into the effect that the music genres had on me. To collect my data, after a study session I would gather the following data: Study Period (min), Tasks Completed, Music Genre, Work Environment, Number of Distractions, Time of Day, Amount of Sleep, and Productivity. The productivity variable was a calculated variable. To calculate it I made sure to distinguish the levels of tasks, level 1 to level 5, by the time it should take for a task. These are my judgement before completing the task on how long the task itself should take normally. For example, I level 1 task should take around up to 30 minutes, a level 2 task should take 30 minutes to an hour, a level 3 should take 1-2 hours, and level 4 task should take 2-4 hours, and a level 5 task should take more than 4 hours."

    "text": "I grew up in Orange County, California, where I spent most of my time outdoors—playing sports, hiking, trail running, and spending time at the beach. I was always a curious kid, constantly asking questions and trying to understand how things work. That same curiosity drives me today as I dive deep into topics like renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency.\nAt UCSB, I’m majoring in Environmental Studies with an emphasis in Energy and Sustainability. I’m especially interested in systems-level solutions for decarbonizing the electricity sector—like wind, solar, and battery storage—and I hope to build a career in consulting and project management in the clean energy space. I stay active on campus by participating in intramural soccer leagues, which keep me connected to my love for team sports and help balance my academic life.\nI’ve always loved working in teams, both in recreational and professional settings. Whether it’s collaborating on a group project or helping lead the execution of a larger team effort, I enjoy creating structured plans and helping others execute them effectively.\nWhat motivates me most is impact. I believe working in the energy sector is not only intellectually rewarding, but also deeply fulfilling. As someone with family roots in Peru, I’ve seen the disparities in energy access and quality of life firsthand. One of my long-term goals is to work on international projects that help communities—especially in places like South America—benefit from sustainable and resilient energy systems.\nOutside of academics, I’m usually on the soccer field, exploring a new trail, spending time at the beach, or catching the sunset with my friends. I’m also really into personal development—whether that’s listening to lifestyle and productivity podcasts, journaling to reflect and set goals, tracking my habits, or experimenting with new ways to optimize my daily routine. I enjoy the process of self-improvement just as much as I enjoy learning about how we can build smarter, more sustainable systems."

    "title": "Solar and Battery Storage Design Project",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Project Overview\nFor this project, my colleagues and I designed a residential or commercial solar photovoltaic (PV) system paired with optional battery energy storage (BESS), using Excel modeling and the NREL PVWatts online tool. The objective was to evaluate system performance, electricity bill impacts, and financial viability under California’s Net Energy Metering (NEM) 2.0 policy.\n\n\nSite Selection and Demand Modeling\nFor the location of our project, we selected a real residential site—one of my colleague’s homes in Isla Vista, California. Using the actual annual electricity utility bills, we were able to model the household’s year-round energy demand with realistic assumptions. The system was designed under California’s NEM 2.0 policy, which offers less favorable compensation for excess solar energy exported to the grid. As a result, we optimized the PV system to meet approximately 90–95% of the household’s annual electricity demand, minimizing surplus generation. After refining system parameters and capacity, our final design met 93.84% of the home’s annual energy needs through solar production.\n\n\nModeling Assumptions and Tools\nThe analysis included key parameters such as monthly and hourly electricity demand– explained above–, utility time-of-use (TOU) rates, solar irradiance, and technical specifications for both PV and battery systems. For the Excel model framework, we simulated hourly generation and demand for an entire year, allowing me to assess net electricity imports, state-of-charge (SOC) dynamics, and cost comparisons across scenarios: no solar, solar-only, and solar plus battery storage.\n\n\nBattery Dispatch Logic\nTo model the battery energy storage system (BESS), we followed a simplified dispatch algorithm guided by solar availability, time-of-use (TOU) rates, and system constraints. The battery was programmed to charge only when two conditions were met: (1) there was a solar surplus (generation exceeded demand), and (2) TOU electricity rates were low—typically during off-peak periods. The amount of energy charged was limited by the minimum of three values: the solar surplus available, the battery’s maximum power capacity, and the remaining energy capacity (determined by the difference between the maximum storage limit and the current state of charge).\nSimilarly, the battery was set to discharge only during solar deficits (when demand exceeded solar generation) and during high TOU rate periods—typically from 4 PM to 9 PM. Discharge was capped by the smallest of three limits: the current solar deficit, the battery’s maximum power output, and the existing state of charge. This algorithm allowed us to maximize bill savings by shifting solar energy from low-cost times to high-cost demand periods, while staying within technical and energy constraints. For this exercise, we ignored charging/discharging efficiency losses to keep the model focused on dispatch logic and financial outcomes.\n\n\nKey Outputs and Metrics\nThe final outputs included metrics like percentage of demand met by solar, annual bill savings, levelized cost of energy (LCOE), and simple payback period—providing a holistic view of both the environmental and economic performance of the proposed system.\n\n\nTakeaways and Reflections\nThis project gave me valuable hands-on experience in designing and analyzing distributed solar and battery storage systems. I deepened my understanding of how time-of-use electricity pricing, net metering policies, and system sizing interact to affect both energy performance and economic outcomes. Working with real-world data—from solar irradiance to utility rates—helped me connect technical modeling with policy and financial considerations. Most importantly, the project reinforced the importance of designing systems that are not only efficient, but also aligned with user demand patterns and local market incentives. These skills and insights will be directly applicable to future work in renewable energy planning and sustainable energy solutions.\n\n\nModel Files\nIf you’d like to explore the full data set — including hourly demand, solar generation, and battery behavior — you can download the original Excel model here:\nDownload Full Excel Model (XLSX)\n\n\nPVWatts Results\nBelow, I’ve included the NREL PVWatts Calculator results, which were used to inform several key system assumptions such as solar irradiance, system losses, and annual generation estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{lescano2025,\n  author = {Lescano, Lukas},\n  title = {Solar and {Battery} {Storage} {Design} {Project}},\n  date = {2025-05-02},\n  url = {https://lperusa7.github.io/lukaslescano.github.io/posts/solar_and_battery_storage_design_project/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nLescano, Lukas. 2025. “Solar and Battery Storage Design\nProject.” May 2, 2025. https://lperusa7.github.io/lukaslescano.github.io/posts/solar_and_battery_storage_design_project/."
