I grew up in Orange County, California, where I spent most of my time outdoors—playing sports, hiking, trail running, and spending time at the beach. I was always a curious kid, constantly asking questions and trying to understand how things work. That same curiosity drives me today as I dive deep into topics like renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency.

Below I have included a plethora of hikes in Santa Barbara and around Orange County, my hometown:

```{r set up}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warnng: false
library(tidyverse)
library(leaflet)
library(leaflet.extras)
library(here)
library(janitor)

# read in data from hikes
hikes <- read_csv(here
                  ("data", "hiking_cords.csv"))
```

```{r clean data}
#| echo: false
hikes_clean <- hikes |> 
  clean_names()
```

```{r icon}
#| echo: false
hikes_icon <- makeIcon(
  iconUrl = here::here("media", "hikes_icon2.png"),
  iconWidth = 20, iconHeight = 20
)
```

```{r making map}
#| echo: false
hikes_map <- leaflet() %>%
  addProviderTiles(providers$Esri.WorldImagery) %>% 
  setView(lng = -118.17, lat = 33.83, zoom = 7) %>%
  addMarkers(data = hikes_clean,
             group = "trail_names",
             icon = hikes_icon,
             lng = ~longitude,
             lat = ~latitude,
             popup = ~paste("Trail Name:", trail_names, "<br>", "Coordinates (lat/long):", latitude, ",", longitude))

At UCSB, I’m majoring in Environmental Studies with an emphasis in Energy and Sustainability. I’m especially interested in systems-level solutions for decarbonizing the electricity sector—like wind, solar, and battery storage—and I hope to build a career in consulting and project management in the clean energy space. I stay active on campus by participating in intramural soccer leagues, which keep me connected to my love for team sports and help balance my academic life.

I’ve always loved working in teams, both in recreational and professional settings. Whether it’s collaborating on a group project or hexlping lead the execution of a larger team effort, I enjoy creating structured plans and helping others execute them effectively.

What motivates me most is impact. I believe working in the energy sector is not only intellectually rewarding, but also deeply fulfilling. As someone with family roots in Peru, I’ve seen the disparities in energy access and quality of life firsthand. One of my long-term goals is to work on international projects that help communities—especially in places like Peru—benefit from sustainable and resilient energy systems.

Outside of academics, I’m usually on the soccer field, exploring a new trail, spending time at the beach, or catching the sunset with my friends. I’m also really into personal development—whether that’s listening to lifestyle and productivity podcasts, journaling to reflect and set goals, tracking my habits, or experimenting with new ways to optimize my daily routine. I enjoy the process of self-improvement just as much as I enjoy learning about how we can build smarter, more sustainable systems.
