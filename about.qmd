title: "About Me"

I grew up in Orange County, California, where I spent much of my time outdoors, playing sports, hiking, trail running, and spending time at the beach. From a young age, I was constantly asking questions and trying to understand how systems function. That curiosity has evolved into a deep interest in how energy systems, infrastructure, and spatial data shape the world around us.

I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Studies at UC Santa Barbara, with an emphasis in GIS and Energy & Sustainability. My academic and project work focuses on renewable energy integration, geospatial analysis, and systems-level approaches to decarbonization. I am particularly interested in how spatial data, strategic planning, and emerging technologies can accelerate the transition toward resilient, low-carbon infrastructure.

I am drawn to roles that combine technical analysis with structured problem-solving, whether in consulting, energy planning, or project management. I enjoy building clear frameworks, organizing complex information, and working collaboratively to turn ideas into actionable strategies.

What motivates me most is impact. Working in the energy sector is both intellectually challenging and personally meaningful. As someone with family roots in Peru, I have seen firsthand how disparities in energy access can affect quality of life and economic opportunity. In the long term, I hope to contribute to international projects that expand sustainable and reliable energy systems in underserved regions, particularly across Latin America.

Outside of academics and professional development, I stay active through soccer, hiking, and spending time outdoors. I also value personal growth and continuous improvement, whether through reflective journaling, productivity systems, or exploring ways to optimize how I learn and work. I approach both sustainability and self-development with the same mindset: incremental improvements compound into meaningful long-term change.
